# ForestRedisCMD

**[ForestRedisAPI JavaDoc 1.0.7](https://foresttechmc.github.io/ForestRedisAPI/1.0.7/)**

This fork of ForestRedisAPI adds a configuration section and a listener to commands sent as plain text on selected redis channels.
Whitelists and blacklists can be selected for these commands in order to improve security.
This fork will track ForestRedisAPI for every other purpose.

### Usage

Refer to [ForestRedisAPI](https://github.com/ForestTechMC/ForestRedisAPI) for API usage. Command config should be self-explanatory.

###### Why a fork?
Because this addition is clearly out of scope for a Redis API.
###### Why not a standalone addition?
This is still a useful redis-related functionality that is small enough to fit in a fork.
